# Vulkan RadFoam Real-Time Ray Tracing Renderer

[![License](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-blue.svg)](LICENSE)

This project is a partial implementation of the [RadFoam](https://radfoam.github.io/) paper, featuring a real-time ray tracing renderer built with the Vulkan SDK. It supports user navigation and novel view synthesis, with a focus on familiarizing myself with Vulkan and improving rendering performance.

---

## Key Features ✨

- **Real-Time Ray Tracing**: Built using Vulkan and GLSL for efficient rendering
- **User Navigation**: Intuitive keyboard controls for 6-DOF scene exploration
- **High Performance**: Optimized for fast rendering speeds (200+ FPS)

---

## Current Limitations ⚠️
- **Color Artifacts**: Occasional color artifacts when loading PLY files (caused by upstream PLY saving implementation)
- **Platform Support**: Currently limited to Windows Vulkan implementations

---

## Build and Run 🛠️

### Prerequisites
- [xmake](https://xmake.io/) build system
- Vulkan SDK 1.3+
- GPU with Vulkan 1.3 support

### Quick Start
```bash
git clone https://github.com/lzlcs/vulkan-radfoam-viewer.git
cd vulkan-radfoam-viewer
xmake b
xmake r radfoam-vulkan-viewer [path/to/your_scene.ply]
```

## User Controls 🎮
| Movement        | Rotation           |
|-----------------|--------------------|
| `W` - Forward   | `J` - Roll Left    |
| `S` - Backward  | `L` - Roll Right   |
| `A` - Left      | `I` - Tilt Up      |
| `D` - Right     | `K` - Tilt Down    |
| `Q` - Ascend    | `U` - Rotate CW    |
| `E` - Descend   | `O` - Rotate CCW   |

## Future Roadmap 🚀
1. 🔄 Dynamic swapchain recreation for window resizing
2. 🎛️ Enhanced camera control parameters
3. 📱 Cross-platform support (Android/MacOS Metal)
4. 🧩 Modular architecture refactoring
5. 🎨 Advanced material system integration
